# Change detection

Change detection in slicky is really easy, since there is only one rule you need to remember - **use only immutable 
variables**.

The best and easies way to work with immutable types is with [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) 
library. You can look at an example [todo](../packages/examples/examples/todo) app.
